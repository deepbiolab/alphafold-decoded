Tensors of higher order extend this concept into additional dimensions. A colored image for example, is usually represented by a three-dimensional tensor of shape (3, H, W), where H and W are the height and width of  the image in pixels.

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

    "This notebook provided a solid introduction to tensor manipulations in PyTorch. Remember, learning is an ongoing process, and even experienced developers continually expand their knowledge base. The skills you practiced here will be valuable as you encounter new challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll explore the fundamentals of machine learning by building a feed-forward classifier for handwritten digits. We'll introduce the concept of feature hierarchies, where multiple layers learn to identify increasingly complex patterns. You'll also learn gradient descent – a cornerstone technique for optimizing machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following that, we'll delve into attention mechanisms (you've already seen the basics with scaled dot-product attention!) and apply them to construct a key AlphaFold component: MultiHeadAttention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll start implementing AlphaFold's core architecture. Congratulations on making it so far! Stay tuned as we embark on this exciting journey."
